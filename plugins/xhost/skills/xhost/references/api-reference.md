## POST /apps

Create a new app. Provisions a git repository and a `prod` channel automatically.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "template": "static"
}
```

- `name` (string, required) — Must be a valid DNS label and must not use a reserved prefix (see Hostname Rules)
- `template` (string, optional, default `"static"`) — Runtime template. Valid values: `"static"` (nginx static file serving) and `"app"` (user-provided `install.sh` + `launch.sh`). `"node"` is accepted as an alias for `"app"`. The `app` template runs inside an `xhost-runtime` image with Node 22, Python 3.12, and build tools pre-installed. The user provides `install.sh` (optional, installs dependencies) and `launch.sh` (required, starts the app on `$PORT`).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "my-app",
  "repo_url": "https://git.<domain>/<username>/<app>.git",
  "template": "static",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "channels": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "prod",
      "hostname": "my-app-alice.xhostd.com",
      "git_ref_binding": "branch:master",
      "current_sha": null,
      "status": "provisioning"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid app name, reserved prefix, name already taken, or invalid template
- `bad_request` (400) — could not provision git backend

---

```json
{
  "deploy_id": "uuid",
  "channel_id": "uuid",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint must be called explicitly after `git push` to trigger a deploy. Pushing code does not automatically deploy.

- `not_found` (404) — app or channel not found

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/logs?deploy={deploy_id}

```json
{

    {"path": "static/style.css", "kind": "blob", "size": 87}
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app not found, or ref does not exist (e.g. empty repo with no commits yet)

---

## GET /apps/{app_id}/blob

Return the raw bytes of a single file at the given ref. Useful when an agent needs to read existing content before modifying it.

**Query parameters:**

- `ref` (string, optional, default `master`) — Branch name or 40-char SHA.
- `path` (string, required) — Repository-relative file path.

**Response (200):** Raw file bytes (`application/octet-stream`).

**Errors:**
- `not_found` (404) — app, ref, or file not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/changeset

Apply a sparse changeset to the repo and create one real git commit on top of `ref`'s current HEAD (or as the initial commit on an empty branch). Designed for agents without shell access or local git — string values upsert files, `null` deletes, absent paths are unchanged.

**Required scope:** `repo:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "ref": "master",
  "message": "agent: update headline",
  "changes": {
    "index.html": "<!doctype html><h1>hello</h1>",

  }
}
```

- `ref` (string, optional, default `"master"`) — Target branch. Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`. Created if it does not yet exist.
- `message` (string, required) — Commit message. Must be non-empty.
- `changes` (object, required) — Map of repo-relative path → string (upsert) or `null` (delete). Paths must be relative and must not contain `..` segments.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "sha": "def456abcdef456abcdef456abcdef456abcdef4"
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint creates a commit but does not deploy. Pass the returned `sha` to `POST /apps/{app_id}/channels/{channel_id}/deploy` to ship it. Same two-step model as `git push` followed by deploy.

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid path, invalid branch name, empty message, or malformed changeset
- `not_found` (404) — app not found

---

## POST /apps/{app_id}/env

**Required scope:** `deploy:*`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "key": "MY_VAR",
  "value": "my-value"
}
```

- `key` (string, required) — Must match `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`. Reserved keys `XHOST_USER` and `XHOST_SHA` are rejected.
- `value` (string, required) — The value to set (stored encrypted).

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**
- `bad_request` (400) — invalid key format or reserved key

---

## DELETE /apps/{app_id}/env/{key}

  "scopes": ["repo:*", "deploy:*", "channel:*"],
  "label": "my-ci-token",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Note:** The `plaintext` value is only returned once at creation time. Store it securely.

---

## DELETE /tokens/{token_id}

Revoke a token by its UUID. Only the token's owner can revoke it.

**Response:** 204 No Content

**Errors:**

    "mem_limit_mb": 256.0,
    "mem_percent": 17.7,
    "cpu_current_percent": 2.5,

    }
  ],
  "collected_at": "2025-01-15 10:30:00 UTC"
}
```

**Notes:**
- Returns only the calling user's own apps, channels, deploys, and resource usage.
- Resource usage (`resources`) reflects the user's systemd cgroup slice (memory and CPU budgets). Values are zero if cgroup limits are not configured.

---

## Hostname Rules

All user-facing names (app names, usernames, channel names) must be valid **DNS labels**:

- Lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`)
- 1 to 40 characters
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- Regex: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$`

**Reserved app name prefixes** (blocked as exact match or `<prefix>-*`):
`git`, `api`, `www`, `admin`, `preview`, `staging`

**Reserved channel names** (cannot be user-created):
`prod`

**Hostname derivation:**
- Production channel: `<app>-<username>.<domain>` (e.g., `myapp-alice.xhostd.com`)
- Other channels: `<channel>-<app>-<username>.<domain>` (e.g., `wildcard-myapp-alice.xhostd.com`)
- Fan-out preview channels: `preview-<branch-slug>-<app>-<username>.<domain>`

---

## Channel Status Values

- `provisioning` — Channel has been created but no deploy has completed yet
- `running` — A deploy has completed successfully and the channel is serving traffic

---

## Deploy Status Values

- `queued` — Deploy is waiting to be picked up by the worker
- `running` — Deploy is currently building/deploying
- `success` — Deploy completed successfully
- `failed` — Deploy failed (check logs for details)

---

## git_ref_binding Format

Must match the pattern `branch:<name>` or `branch:*`.

- `branch:master` — Triggers on pushes to the `master` branch
- `branch:staging` — Triggers on pushes to the `staging` branch
- `branch:*` — Wildcard; deploying a branch that matches the wildcard creates a child channel named `preview-<slug>` bound to `branch:<actual-branch-name>`.

The `<name>` portion (when not `*`) must match: `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9/_\-\.]*$`

---
